# elections2020
Thanks to the joint work of the "[Honest People](https://honest-people.by)", "[Zubr](https://zubr.in/)" and "[Voice](https://belarus2020.org/home)" platforms, it was possible to obtain and process the final protocols of **1,310** polling stations out of **5,767** during Belarusian presidential election.
